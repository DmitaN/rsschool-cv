### About me
I have been in IT for more than 12 years. I have experience in developing desktop applications and working with databases. I am actively studying frontend development now, because I see a great future in it. And also the result is visible immediately, which motivates you to continue learning. I want to gain experience in development for European customers and companies. 

 I also practice Japanese martial arts, such as Judo and Iaido. I am a three-time champion of Russia in Jodo. I am a champion in team competitions at the Iaido Championship of Russia.
